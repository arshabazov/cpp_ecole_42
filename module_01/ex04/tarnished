Foul tarnished
In search of the Elden Ring.
Emboldened by the flame of ambition.
Someone must extinguish thy flame.

Well, a lowly tarnished, playing as a lord.
I command thee kneel!

Bearer of the Curse.
Seek Souls, larger and more powerful Souls.
Seek the King, that is the only way.
Lest this land swallow you whole, as it has so many others.
